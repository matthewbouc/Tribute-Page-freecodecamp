			<h2>The Blooming of Kira Poppyseed:        
      </h2>
			<ul id="list">
        <li> <strong>March 15th, 2020</strong> - In Emerald, Wisconsin, Annie, a young corgi, gives birth to her first litter.  Amoung this squalling sack of potatoes, rustled an autumn-colored little girl, Kira Poppyseed.</li>
        <li><strong>April 12th</strong> - Kira has proven herself to be an extroverted and inquisitive young pup, despite being one of the smallest in the litter.</li>
        <li><strong>May 8th</strong> - Kira is adopted by her family and brought into a loving home that would foster her outgoing personality and excessive need to play.</li>
        <li><strong>May</strong> - Kira gains confidence in her new home and shows she's quick to learn and strong-willed.  Giraffes, pigs, sheep - no matter their size, she rules over the stuffed animal kingdom.  As games become more intense, Kira made it well aware that a round of tug-o-war would never be forfeited, an adage she would hold onto forever.</li>
        <li><strong>June</strong> - Kira is the talk of the town.  She's young, beautiful, and <i>so soft</i>!  Not a single walk can be taken without strangers approaching for pictures or pets.  Never the shy type, Kira took to the fame, love, and attention in full stride.</li>
        <li><strong>June 15th</strong> - As the days grow hotter and longer, Kira's interest in water begins to peak.  With little hesitation, she takes her first dive into the pool and barrels a foot underwater.</li>
        <li><strong>July</strong> - By mid-summer, Kira has mastered swimming; however, the best part of swimming is drying off. Kira zooms around the freshly cut lawn in the hot July sun before plopping down on a deck chair - <i>pure bliss</i>.</li>
        <li><strong>August</strong> - Kira picks up new hobbies.  Kayaking and camping might seem daunting to most young pups, but Kira Poppyseed held no fear for the unknown (unless the unknown was a cardboard box).</li>
        <li><strong>August</strong> - "Will this month ever end" Kira asked herself.  Taylor's falls, Long Lake, and Manitowoc!  How much car time can a puppy take?!</li>
        <li><strong> September</strong> - Grand Island, Nebraska?!!!  It seemed that this young traveler may have bitten off more than she could chew.  Yet, little Kira Poppyseed stayed strong and full of energy.  As leaves begin to fall, Kira enjoys her time dashing through the piles.</li>
        <li><strong>October</strong> - Kira becomes a woman.  Unfortunately, woman puppies have to wear diapers in the house.  Thankfully, Winter comes early!  Balls, sticks, and frisbees have to be returned... Snowballs are infinite!</li>
        <li><strong>October 29th</strong> - An illness takes hold of the vibrant, young pup.  Despite feeling so sick, all Kira wants is her broccoli thrown one more time before bed.  As the night progresses, so do Kira's symptoms.  An emergency vet visit is necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>October 30th</strong> - Kira is diagnosed with gastroenteritis, given anti-nausea meds, and sent home.  An uncomfortable GI issue, but nothing some rest and a bland diet can't fix.</li>
        <li><strong>October 31st</strong> - As the day continues, Kira's illness worsens.  She's rapidly exhausted by even the smallest of tasks.  Most of the day is spent napping.</li>
        <li><strong>November 1st</strong> - As day breaks, Kira is unable to walk, stand, or move.  Again, she is rushed to the ER; her illness has clearly progressed to a serious level.  The doctors are baffled.  All their tests come back negative.  No viruses, bacteria, or obstructions.. nothing.  The doctors suggest a neurological exam.</li>
        <li><strong>November 2nd</strong> - Kira is transferred to the neurological department at the U of M.  An early evening neurological exam led doctors to believe she has a disease called Myasthenia Gravis (MG).  The test for MG has to be sent out and can take weeks for results.  With Kira still unable to move any muscles in her body, the doctors move forward with an MG therapy.</li>
        <li><strong>November 3rd</strong> - In a miraculous fashion, Kira wakes and is able to move!  The drugs were working wonderfully, and Kira was unofficially diagnosed with MG, pending test results.  She's doing so well that the doctors prescibed a medication to take home and Kira was able to leave the hospital that same day.</li>
        <li><strong>November 4th</strong> - The medication is working, but doesn't seem to be in full effect.  Kira is only able to move around slightly and only for a short period.  By the time her next dosage is due, the medicine has already worn off and Kira is virtually paralyzed again.</li>
        <li><strong>November 5th</strong> - Kira's dosage is increased.  The effects of a higher dose are immediately obvious.  A few hours after her dose, Kira is up and clumsily running around.  She's playing with toys and barking at neighbor dogs.  The excitement of moving again is exhausting, though, and Kira gets tired quickly.  At least she's back in mom and dad's bed for the night!</li>
        <li><strong>November 6th</strong> - The medication seems to be working better still during the day.  Kira is able to play fetch and run a full length of the yard.  Unfortunately, the medication doesn't seem to be lasting as long as expected.  Kira's muscles, once again, significantly weakened before the next dose was due.</strong>
      <li><strong>November 6th, 6:20pm</strong> - Myasthenia gravis affects each individual differently.  The most fatal form of MG prevents the individual from properly using muscles that surround the GI tract, specifically those in the chest, neck, and throat.  Kira was affected by this type of MG.  At 6:20pm on November 6th, 2020, Kira began to have difficulties breathing.  The medication Kira was receiving was both a burden and a gift, a true double-edged sword.  It gave her the strength to continue living a normal life, but one of the drug's side effects was the production of excess saliva and phlegm.  With Kira's esophagus muscles weakened, she could no longer swallow properly.  Kira began to aspirate on her own saliva.  Kira was rushed to the closest clinic, 25 minutes away.</li>
      <li><strong>November 6th, 6:40pm</strong> - The amount of fluids in Kira's lungs and esophagus hit a critical level.  At 6:40pm, Kira passed away while en route to the ER.

      You entered our lives intense and bright,<br/>
      Filling our hearts with joy and light.<br/>
      You blazed around this home of ours,<br/>
      Illuminating each room with toys of yours.<br/>
      You asked for naught but a playful minute,<br/>
      Returning love without a limit.<br/>
      Now we sit here cast in sorrow,<br/>
      Wondering if you'll be home tomorrow.<br/>
      I have your toy, please come and play,<br/>
      If only to see you for one more day.</p>
